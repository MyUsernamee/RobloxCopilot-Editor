# RobloxCopilot-Editor
Welcome to the open source editor for the Roblox Copilot Editor!
Currently it is being put together.

## What is this?

This is a open source editor for a upcoming plugin for roblox. The idea is to make a very modifiable editor for people to use!

## Why?

Recently there was a project created by microsoft or github called github copilot. It uses some of the most cutting edge AI to act as the most cracked up auto complete ever.

For instance it is possible github copilot to write entire functions for you from a comment.
